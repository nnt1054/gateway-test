#### Background
I wanted to make this site for three primary reasons:
1. Showcase personal projects/work along with my general work flow
2. Have a consolidated place to maintain school and technical notes
3. Develop some sort of online personality/brand/presence for self expression and recruitment purposes :)

Other reasons for making this site include practicing web design and development, gaining more experience with CSS animations and transitions, and learning another framework (jekyll).

#### Userflow
Here's a low quality H I G H spec of the site userflow :)
